## Learning outcomes

After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of how static source code analyzers work. You will also get more experience with object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and file processing. You will practice using the abstract syntax tree, and, last but not least, learn more about the rules of Python code style.

## About

In this project, you will create a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code. You will get a general idea of static code analysis and expand your competence in Python.

## Stages

Stage 1/5: Search for long lines
Write a program that performs a simple code style check and finds lines that are too long.

Stage 2/5: New checks
Add checks for proper use of indentation, semicolons, spaces before comments, TODOs, and blank lines.

Stage 3/5: Analyze multi-file projects
Learn how to work with multiple files and directories and process command-line arguments.

Stage 4/5: Check names according to PEP8
Use regular expressions to check proper naming.

Stage 5/5: Analyze arguments and variables
Use the Abstract Syntax Tree to polish your program. Your own tool for analyzing code style issues is ready to use!
