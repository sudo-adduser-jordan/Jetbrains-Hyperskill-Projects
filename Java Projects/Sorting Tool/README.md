## Learning outcomes

Become familiar with Collections and learn to work with files, arguments, and the command line.


## About

In the modern world, data has become so abundant that processing it is no easy business. How can anyone make sense of all these words and numbers? In this project, you will write a program that processes textual and numeric data and sorts it. Your program will be able to determine the biggest or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary calculations on them. Data is waiting to be sorted!

## Stages

Stage 1/6: Numbers only
Start by teaching your program to process numeric data. Feed it some numbers and ask it to determine the largest value and its frequency in the data set. 

Stage 2/6: Not just numbers
Data can also be words or phrases, and your program should be able to handle them just as well. Enable your program to process different types of data and determine the greatest/longest input elements, as well as their frequency in the data set.

Stage 3/6: Sorting it out
Start implementing the core part of your program: sorting.

Stage 4/6: Everything counts
Implement sorting for all types of data and learn how to use Collections to calculate, store, and display the elementsâ€™ frequency.

Stage 5/6: Error!
Oh no! Someone is misusing the arguments! Make the program notify users about such errors if they occur.

Stage 6/6: X-files
Make it possible for your program to use files for input and output.
