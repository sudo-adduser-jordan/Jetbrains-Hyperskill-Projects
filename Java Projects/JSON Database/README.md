## Learning outcomes

You will get a firm grasp of working with JSON in Java. You will also practice parallelization and see how to implement processing multiple requests at the same time.

## About

JSON is a ubiquitous format for exchanging data between web servers and browsers. Its simple design and flexibility make it easy to understand and use in the programming language of your choice. You will create a client-server application that allows the clients to store their data on the server in JSON format.

## Stages

Stage 1/6: 100-cell database
Create a simple array-based database that can store up to a hundred cells of data.

Stage 2/6: Network connection
Create a server that allows clients to connect and send messages.

Stage 3/6: Simple online database
Make your server functional and add the option to exit the program.

Stage 4/6: Hello, JSON
Convert requests and responses to JSON format.

Stage 5/6: Multithreaded server
Allow your server to handle multiple requests at the same time.

Stage 6/6: Complex keys
Process operations with complex keys.
