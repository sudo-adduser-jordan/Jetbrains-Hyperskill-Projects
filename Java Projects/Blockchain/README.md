 Learning outcomes

Get a profound understanding of how blockchains work, apply your hashing and multithreading skills and learn about (de)serialization: many great topics in one exciting project.

 About

Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. In this project, you will try yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain. As difficult as the project might be, it is bound to pay off: not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and skills.


Stage 1/6: Blockchain essentials
Get to know the structure of blockchains: learn how to create blocks and make them secured and connected.

Stage 2/6: A proof of work concept
Make cryptocurrency mining possible in your virtual world: generate magic numbers and store them in blocks.

Stage 3/6: Miner mania
Generate random numbers in several threads; when a miner finds the magic number, a blockchain is created, and mining goes on.

Stage 4/6: You've got a message
Learn to store data in the blocks: add messages to your blockchain.

Stage 5/6: Matters of security
Add encryption with private and public keys to ensure a high level of privacy and security.

Stage 6/6: Local currency
Create a cryptocurrency in your program: starting with a sorry amount of zero coins, your virtual miners will get a hundred for each block they mine.
