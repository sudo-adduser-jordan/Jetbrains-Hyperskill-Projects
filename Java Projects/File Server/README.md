## Learning outcomes

You will learn how to work with sockets and also improve your multithreading skills.

## About

It's so easy to lose your precious data â€” unless you store it on a server. Besides, file servers allow you to access your files remotely, no matter where you are. In this project, you will create your own file server, even though a simple one.

## Stages

Stage 1/4: Storage emulator
For a start, write a program that simulates the work of a file storage server.

Stage 2/4: Networking
Time to practice using sockets: establish a client-server connection and learn how to handle errors on your server.

Stage 3/4: Save a text file
Save a simple text file on your server: enter the name and the contents of the file and save it.

Stage 4/4: Save anything
Upgrade your server so that it can handle any type of files using multithreading and serialization.
