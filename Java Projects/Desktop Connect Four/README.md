## Learning outcomes

Learn about multidimensional arrays, a variety of loops, and how to utilize Java Swing library to create a user interface. Write a complicated algorithm to check the game board for a winning condition after each turn and highlight the winning move.


## About

Tired of playing Tic-Tac-Toe? Want something a little more challenging? Connect Four is a great game that fuses the complexity of a larger game board and the need to line up more pieces. In this project, you will create a version of the game with a graphical user interface that you can run on your computer.

## Stages

Stage 1/4: Setting up the board
Create a game board divided into cells using Java Swing library.

Stage 2/4: Placing the pieces
Enable the cells on the board to accept user input and place the appropriate piece based on a player's turn.

Stage 3/4: Filling the board
Make the cells in a column respond as a unit to fill the board from the bottom row.

Add an algorithm to check for a winner after every click and then highlight the winning cells. 
Stage 4/4: Players Ready
