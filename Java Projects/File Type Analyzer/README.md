 Learning outcomes

Figure out multithreading and learn to work with Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, a must-know for every developer. Consider Rabin-Karp algorithm the icing on the cake. Good luck!


 About

Files come in all possible formats: we usually see it specified in their names. Even if the file type was manual changed or even removed, information about the type is always contained within the file. And in this project, you will write a tool that will extract this info to determine the type of the file. You’ll try out different algorithms to solve this problem, and will see for yourself how using different algorithms will change the speed of the tool.




Stage 1/5: Is this a PDF?
PDF or not PDF, that is the question. Teach your program to determine whether your file is of this format or not: it’s a nice start.

Stage 2/5: KMP algorithm
Using the old favourite Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, improve your search and enable the program to display the time elapsed.

Stage 3/5: Wanted!
Practice your multithreading skills and apply Callable and Future interfaces to enable your analyzer to search for files with specific extensions.

Stage 4/5: A question of priorities
With the help of Insertion and Merge sort, allow your program to recognize 14 different types of extension and prioritize your sort.

Stage 5/5: Rabin-Karp
Improve and speed up the search using Rabin-Karp algorithm.
