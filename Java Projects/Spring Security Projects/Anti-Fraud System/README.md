 Learning outcomes

Create a RESTfull web service using SpringBoot, learn the basics of user authentication and authorization. Get to know the fundamentals of fraud detection and rule-based systems.


 About

This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. For this project, we will work on a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.


Stage 1/6: Simple transaction alidation
Stage 2/6: Authentication
Stage 3/6: Authorization
Stage 4/6: Stolen cards & suspicious IPs
Stage 5/6: Rule-based system
Stage 6/6: Feedback


Learn and practice the basics of Spring Web and REST controllers by implementing a simple logic that specifies the validity of a transaction with simple conditions.

Implement user registration and authentication procedures using Spring Security.

Implement roles and grant access rights to users.

Upgrade the fraud detection rules by taking advantage of stolen card data and suspicious IP-address pool.

Create a rule-based system, a simple and effective artificial intelligence method, and practice complex conditional logic.

Add feedback to the validation process.
