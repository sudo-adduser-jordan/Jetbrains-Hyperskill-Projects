## Learning outcomes

Create a RESTfull web service using SpringBoot, learn the basics of user authentication and authorization. Get to know the fundamentals of fraud detection and rule-based systems.

## About

This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. For this project, we will work on a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.

## Stages

Stage 1/6: Simple transaction alidation
Learn and practice the basics of Spring Web and REST controllers by implementing a simple logic that specifies the validity of a transaction with simple conditions.

Stage 2/6: Authentication
Implement user registration and authentication procedures using Spring Security.

Stage 3/6: Authorization
Implement roles and grant access rights to users.

Stage 4/6: Stolen cards & suspicious IPs
Upgrade the fraud detection rules by taking advantage of stolen card data and suspicious IP-address pool.

Stage 5/6: Rule-based system
Create a rule-based system, a simple and effective artificial intelligence method, and practice complex conditional logic.
