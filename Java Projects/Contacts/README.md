 Learning outcomes

You will learn the essential basics of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance will allow you to write code that can perform the same process but for different objects. Polymorphism helps to initiate different processes for different objects by using the same method. Youâ€™ll also learn to prevent other users of your code to modify the variables using encapsulation.

 About

Here is something you probably use regularly: contacts. In this project, you will write a program to create contacts (like on the mobile phone) and search for people or organizations by name.



Stage 1/4: First contact
Using classes, create your first contact with a name, last name and phone number.

Stage 2/4: Create a menu
Working with encapsulation and regular expressions, create a menu that will allow to add and edit contacts.

Stage 3/4: Upgrade your contacts
With the help of inheritance mechanism, add the ability to specify details in your contacts (for example, gender) and to create contacts and addresses of organizations.

Stage 4/4: Searching
Get familiar with polymorphism and built-in functions: fix your code and make it possible to search for contacts.
