## About

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà, a burst of raw energy is in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on a coffee machine simulator. This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.

## Stages

Stage 1/6: Making coffee
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen. Let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

Stage 2/6: Ingredient Calculator
The machine should calculate how many ingredients it needs to make the required amount of coffee.

Stage 3/6: Coffee for all
Program the machine to calculate how many cups it can make based on the number of set ingredients.

Stage 4/6: Buy, fill, take!
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, replenish the supplies, and serve the coffee.

Stage 5/6: Keeping track of supplies
Program the machine to display how many supplies it has on the screen. Work on the main loop: now, the menu keeps updating until users choose to exit.

Stage 6/6: The sandbox
Enhance your coffee machine with any new functionality you wish to add.
